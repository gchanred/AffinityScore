# AffinityScore

Place the document that you want scored in the same folder as the code file "affinity_calculator.py"

To score the document, run the following code in your command prompt (replace "name_of_your_document" with your file name): 
    python affinity_calculator.py name_of_your_document

After execution, a new file called name_of_your_document**_results.csv** is created in the same folder, with the final scores.
